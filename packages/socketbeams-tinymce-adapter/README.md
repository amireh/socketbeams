## Try it

- run `npm install`
- run `npm run build`
- `open examples/basic/index.html`
- try typing one word at a time slowly (a second between each update, you have to tab out or blur the editor to commit)
  + it should maintain state
- try typing quickly with enter keypresses
  + it should go out of sync and display some error details
